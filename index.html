        <h1>Types of bikes</h1>
        <p>Looking for a new ride? Sometimes the jargon can be a little intimidating. 
           The good news is that you donâ€™t have to become fluent in bike speak to decide which bike is best for your two-wheeled adventures.</p>

        <p>Start by asking yourself where you plan to ride: on streets, bike paths, unpaved roads and trails or some combination of those places?</p>

        <p> Bikes are an expression sometimes. Often times its an expression of a healthy lifestyle typically due to the fact that cycling is a great
            aerobic activity. Other times, it can just be a mode of transportation from point A to B. No matter which way you see it, bicycles are undeniably
            useful tools that are versatile and can be used in a variety of different settings and road types.
        </p>
        
        <p> When you're looking into buying any type of bike, the most important thing is to look at the repairability of the bike. Rather it be a mountain bike,
            or a road bike, repairability is something every bike user should have in mind. Researching extensively about the bike or bikes of your choosing will 
            help you in getting a better grasp at what you want. And in this day and age, there are massive forums about each type of bike you're interested in as 
            well as countless videos and discussion posts around the internet.
